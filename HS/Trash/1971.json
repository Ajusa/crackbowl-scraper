If the Wronskian determinant is not this value, then solutions of a diff. EQ. are linearly independent.",

[10] When optimizing subject to equality constraints, one popular method is to set the gradient of the function in question equal to one of these constants times the objective function. These constants are usually written as lambda and are named for a French mathematician. ",
