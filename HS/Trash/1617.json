	"question": "Question: In quantum mechanics, this quantity can be written as the trace over the state space, i.e. the exponential of the negative of the thermodynamic beta times the Hamiltonian. For 10 points each: [10] Name this quantity that is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for all of a system's microstates. The probability that the system occupies a given microstate is its Boltzmann factor divided by this quantity.",
