	"question": "Question: These devices that measure fluid flow velocity are useful for measuring an aircraft's Mach number. They use the static pressure of their internal fluids and measure the stagnation pressure in order to determine velocity. [10] Name this quantity, whose \"group\" type is equal to the partial derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wavenumber and describes wave envelopes.",
