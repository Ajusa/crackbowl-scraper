	"answerText": "well logging [or borehole logging][10] The most important technique in seismology uses a controlled source that emits waves that undergo this process and return to geophones to get a geologic cross-section. It's used more often than refraction because its resolution is much higher.",

More generally, it involves continuous measurement of some physical property that varies in a borehole.",
