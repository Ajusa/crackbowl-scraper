	"answerText": "James Clerk Maxwell[10] The Maxwell relations give equalities among the second partial derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, since the order of partial derivation does not matter. One common relation states that the negative partial of pressure with respect to this quantity is equal to the partial of temperature with respect to volume.",
