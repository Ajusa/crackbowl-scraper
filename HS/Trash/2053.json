	"answerText": "canonical transformations [or contact transformations; or scale transformations; do NOT accept \"point transformations\"][10] One can determine if a transform is canonical by checking whether this matrix for it satisfies the symplectic condition. It contains the partial derivatives of a vector function, and its determinant is used when performing a change of variables for an integral.",

[10] Name these coordinate transforms from small p and small q to big P and big Q, where big P and big Q are functions of small p and small q, that satisfy Hamilton's equations of motion.",
