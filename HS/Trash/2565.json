	"answerText": "NP-complete[10] The best known algorithms for NP-complete problems like k-SAT take at least this worst-case runtime, which implies that P is not equal to NP. A version of the halting problem which asks whether a Turing machine will stop in a finite amount of steps is also solvable in this runtime.",

For 10 points each: [10] This class of problems consists of the problems that are the most difficult problems in NP; formally, a problem is in this class if and only if it is in NP and every problem in NP is reducible to it.",
