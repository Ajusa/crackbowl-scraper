	"answerText": "magnetic monopoles [prompt on \"monopole\"][10] If monopoles did exist, Gauss' law for magnetism would have this number multiplied by the magnetic charge density on one side of the equation, instead of zero. In the proper SI units, this number is 10 to the 7th times larger than the permeability of free space.",
