For 10 points each: [10] This data structure contains ordered elements of items that is accessed by using a hierarchy of pointers, with the lowest level pointer pointing directly to the next element; higher level pointers point further ahead in the sorted structure. Its access and removal times average to the same as the balanced binary search tree.",
