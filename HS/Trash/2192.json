	"question": "Question: This process proceeds via the opening of NMDA glutamate receptors and L type voltage-gated channels, triggering a cascade that inserts additional AMPA receptors. For 10 points each: [10] Name this form of synaptic plasticity, a prolonged enhancement of signal transmission between two neurons. It is an attractive candidate for explaining learning and memory at the cellular level.",
