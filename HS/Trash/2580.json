	"answerText": "magnetization [or magnetic polarization; do not accept anything else][10] Due to quantum effects, this type of magnet can exist, in which the magnetization depends hysteretically on the applied magnetic field. This phenomenon vanishes above the Curie point, and is found in materials like cobalt.",
