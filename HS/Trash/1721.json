	"answerText": "BolzanoWeierstrass theorem[10] Karl Weierstrass formulated many of the basic concepts of analysis, including the first good definition of this property of a function. If a function has this property at a point, the limit of the function's values as you get closer and closer to that point is the same as its value at that point.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name this theorem, which states that any bounded sequence in R-n has a convergent subsequence.",
