	"answerText": "multiplication [or multiplying; or taking the product][10] Although multiplying two matrices of dimension n naively takes n cubed time, this algorithm computes the product in big-O of n to the log-base-2 of 7. The time savings come from having to compute 7 products instead of 8 in each recursive step.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name this binary operation which is commutative for real and complex numbers, but not commutative for matrices. It can be understood as adding a number to itself repeatedly.",
