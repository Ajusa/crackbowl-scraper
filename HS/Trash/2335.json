	"answerText": "Hofmann elimination [or Hofmann degradation][10] The Hofmann elimination violates Zaitsev's rule because it's transition state would be the very bulky gauche if it followed Zaitsev's rule, so these effects outweigh thermodynamic favorability. These effects arise from the fact that atoms within a molecule occupy space.",
