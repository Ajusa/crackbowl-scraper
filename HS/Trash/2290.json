	"answerText": "microtubules[10] The basic units that form microtubules are dimers of alpha and beta tubulin with one of these molecules sandwiched between them. One molecule of this compound is hydrolyzed from the beta subunit when it is added to a microtubule. The Krebs cycle also produces one molecule of this compound.",

	"question": "Question: In-vitro, the minus ends of these structures are more prone to depolymerization, but in-vivo they are not since the minus ends are usually anchored onto other structures. [10] Identify these structures composed of 13 tubulin protofilaments around a hollow center. The anti-cancer drug Taxol works by stabilizing these tubulin polymers and preventing them from forming the mitotic spindle.",
