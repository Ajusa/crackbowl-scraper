	"question": "Question: When this phenomenon causes the electron density in a pi bond to differ from what a single Lewis structure would predict, it's called the mesomeric effect, and this phenomenon explains why all the bonds in benzene have the same length. For 10 points each: [10] Name this effect in which electrons delocalize and molecules exist in a combination of different Lewis structures.",
