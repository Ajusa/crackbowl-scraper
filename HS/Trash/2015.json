Much radio astronomy actually takes place in this slightly shorter wavelength part of the EM spectrum.",

	"question": "Question: The hydroxyl megamaser and this type of megamaser are the most common and best-characterized, and this type of astrophysical maser has an emission line at 22 gigahertz. [10] Name these astrophysical masers that vary significantly with time but are of great importance because they are found at the outer edge of the Milky Way and distance calculation using VLBI parallax measurements is extremely accurate for them.",
