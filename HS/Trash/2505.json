	"answerText": "Diophantine equation [accept word forms][10] Gauss proved this theorem that states that for two primes p and q, x squared equals p mod q, and x squared mod q mod p will have the same solvability unless p and q both equal 3 mod 4. It had resisted the powers of Euler and Legendre, but Gauss found at least 8 proofs of it in his lifetime.",

For 10 points each: [10] Polynomials whose variables take integer values are given this name. Famous examples may be found in Fermat's last theorem and Pell's equation.",
