	"question": "Question: In one theory, the Gibbs free energy per unit volume can be expanded as a local function of this parameter, and the magnitude of this parameter, squared, is proportional to the density of super electrons. For 10 points each: [10] Name this parameter, usually written as the product of a complex phase factor and a modulus, which is found in two coupled differential equations with the magnetic vector potential in that theory.",
