	"answerText": "Light-emitting diode or LED[10] Like most p-n junction devices, LEDs usually operate under forward bias and have negligible current under reverse bias. However, an excessively negative bias will cause this phenomenon, which comes in Zener and avalanche forms and causes a sharp increase in current flow.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name these devices which rely on the spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes to generate electromagnetic radiation. It may help to know that they're far more efficient than your average lightbulb.",
