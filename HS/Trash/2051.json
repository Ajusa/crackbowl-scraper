	"question": "Question: The linear relationship between enantiomeric excess and the amount of this phenomenon breaks down in the Horeau effect, which is seen in succinic acid.  [10] Identify this phenomenon that does not occur in racemic mixtures because they have equal amounts of enantiomers of a chiral compound. Molecules which experience this phenomenon are denoted plus or minus.",
