	"answerText": "fouling [or scaling; prompt on \"deposition\"][10] Forty percent more energy is needed to heat water with surfaces that have a quarter inch of this mineral, which makes up limestone. Its inverse solubility makes it problematic for heat transfer surfaces as it is a major component of hard water.",
