	"answerText": "actin[10] This regulatory protein covers the myosin-binding site on the actin filaments while the muscle is at rest. When calcium ion levels rise in the cytosol, calcium ions bind to the troponin complex, causing this protein to shift and expose the sites.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name this molecule, whose minus end contains a cleft where ATP can bind. It predominantly forms \"thin filaments\" that work with the \"thick filaments\" mostly composed of myosin to contract muscles.",
