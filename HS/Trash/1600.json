	"question": "Question: It was discovered in 1947 that the lambda particle did not decay as fast as predicted, resulting in the formulation of a new conservation law for this property. For 10 points each: [10] Name this quantum number that is +1 for the K-zero meson and -1 for the K-plus meson, but zero for pions and leptons. Like similar numbers, it is generally conserved but can change by one unit in weak interactions.",
