	"answerText": "ergodic hypothesis [or the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics][10] The ergodic hypothesis was originally due to this scientist, who also names a transport equation. A law of blackbody radiation he co-names with Josef Stefan states that the thermal energy per second per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of temperature.",
