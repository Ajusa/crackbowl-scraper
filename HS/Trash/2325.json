	"answerText": "moment of inertia [or I][10] In rigid body dynamics, this mathematician names a set of equations that relates the components of torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration and velocity. This mathematician extended Newton's laws of motion to rigid bodies and developed a set of equations for inviscid flow in fluid dynamics.",
