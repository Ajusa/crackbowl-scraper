	"question": "Question: This phenomenon normally occur in either a dipole or tripole pattern, termed Rex and Omega respectively, with one high pressure ridge and either one of two low pressure areas.  [10] Name this phenomenon in which a persistent high-pressure system diverts mid-latitude weather systems, sometimes causing an area to have the same weather for extended periods of time.",
