	"question": "Question: Tunneling of Cooper pairs can occur between two superconductors that are separated by a thin insulating layer.  [10] These Cooper pairs give rise to what effect in which a spontaneous, zero voltage current proportional to the phase difference of the wavefunctions representing the Cooper pairs develops in the junction.",
