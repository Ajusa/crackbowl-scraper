	"answerText": "BEC [or Bose-Einstein condensate; prompt on Bose gas][10] This theorem, originally due to Wolfgang Pauli, gives between the phase change of a wavefunction for a particle turned 360 degrees and the phase change of a wavefunction when interchanging two particles of the same type. It explains why bosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name this state of matter formed when atoms are cooled near absolute zero, take on the properties of bosons, and occupy the same quantum state. It was first demonstrated with rubidium.",
