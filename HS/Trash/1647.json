	"answerText": "cosmological constant[10] n lieu of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio omega-sub-V between the energy density due to the cosmological constant, and this value. This quantity is equal to three times Hubble's constant squared over 8 pi G in the Friedmann equations.",

For 10 points each: [10] Name this constant that represents the energy density of the vacuum, which can be regarded as the simplest form of dark energy. Einstein called it his \"biggest blunder\", and it is often represented by an uppercase lambda.",
