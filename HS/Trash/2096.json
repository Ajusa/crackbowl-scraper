	"answerText": "CRISPR [or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats][10] CRISPR is analogous to this pathway in eukaryotic cells, which uses siRNA or microRNA to knock down gene expression. This pathway uses the DICER nuclease to create small RNAs, which are loaded into the RISC complex.",
