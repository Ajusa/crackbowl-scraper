	"question": "Question: The electronic symbol for these circuit elements consist of a triangle adjacent to a rectangular S-like shape, and they are characterized by semiconductor-metal junctions, which form a similarly-named barrier. For 10 points each: [10] Name these objects which have a low forward voltage drop and very fast switching action. At around 0.15 to 0.45 volts, their voltage drops are much lower than that of typical silicon diodes.",
