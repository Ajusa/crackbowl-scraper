	"question": "Question: Answer some questions about ways to find the electric field due to a charge configuration [10] For symmetric systems, one might use Gauss's law to relate the charge inside an area to the electric type of this quantity through the boundary. This quantity measures the amount of a field flowing through a surface and the magnetic type adds up to zero for closed surfaces.",
