	"answerText": "helium atom[10] The lowest possible energy to obtain this configuration in helium is when one electron is in the 1s (\"one-s\") orbital and the other is in the 2s (\"two-s\") orbital. This configuration has a total spin of one, and a forbidden transition from it to a ground state is typically what causes phosphorescence.",

	"question": "Question: This system's Hamiltonian contains terms for the kinetic energies of its two electrons, two terms for the attraction between the electrons and the nucleus, and one term for electronelectron repulsion, and generally sucks ass because it's a three-body problem. For 10 points each: [10] Name this system whose electronelectron repulsion term makes its Hamiltonian non-separable and a general bitch to solve. Unlike the simpler hydrogen atom system, an exact wavefunction for this system has not been found.",
