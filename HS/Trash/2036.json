	"answerText": "Christoffel symbols of the second kind [or connection coefficients; or Christ-awful symbols][10] Christoffel symbols play a big role in this theory, since they appear in the geodesic equation and are a component of the Levi-Civita connection. This theory of gravitation was developed by Einstein.",

[10] Identify these things used to express the derivative of a basis vector with respect to a coordinate as a linear combination of the basis vectors at the point at which the derivative is taken. They're often used to simplify the expression of the covariant derivative.",
