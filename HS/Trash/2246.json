	"answerText": "Boltzmann's H-function[10] The H-function was related to the entropy to derive the 2nd law of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics by this physicist. This Austrian physicist's namesake constant is the proportionality constant between entropy and the natural log of the number of microstates and is equal to 1.38 times 10 to the minus 23 Joules per Kelvin.",
