	"question": "Question: These three rules can be used to predict the term symbol for the ground state of an atom. [10] Name this set of  3 rules, the first of which is sometimes called the rule of maximum multiplicity. The second of these rules states that if the multiplicities are equal, the configuration with the largest orbital angular momentum has the lowest energy.",
