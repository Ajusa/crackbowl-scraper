Hoare. Despite having a worst case of \"big-O of n-squared,\" it normally performs faster than other sorts with the same best case of \"big-O of n log n.\"",

For 10 points each: [10] The canonical formulation of this deterministic algorithm chooses an element lying between the 30th and 70th percentile rank of the range of the data set. This algorithm groups every five entries in the data set, and picks the middle elements of each group, then recurses on those middle elements.",
