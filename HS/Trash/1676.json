	"question": "Question: One pathway to accomplish this task responds to modifications like oxidation, alkylation, and deamination, and begins when a DNA glycosylase creates an AP site.  [10] Name this task, for which one mechanism in E. coli uses the UvrABC endonuclease. Problems with that nucleotide excision-based mechanism in humans may cause Cockayne's syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum.",
