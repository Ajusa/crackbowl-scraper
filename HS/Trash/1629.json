	"answerText": "tunnel magnetoresistance [or TMR; prompt on \"magnetoresistance\"][10] Jullière theorized that TMR arises because the density of states at this energy is different for spin-up and spin-down electrons. At absolute zero, this energy is the highest energy occupied by one of the electrons.",

	"question": "Question: The strength of this phenomenon is defined as the difference between the resistances in the parallel and anti-parallel state, divided by the resistance in the parallel state. For 10 points each: [10] Name this phenomenon discovered by Michel Jullière, in which placing an insulator between two ferromagnets makes the rate at which electrons pass through the insulator depend on the ferromagnets' spin polarizations.",
