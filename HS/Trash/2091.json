	"question": "Question: Answer some questions about sequential logic circuit parts, for 10 points each. [10] This logic gate produces a \"1\" if either of its inputs is a \"1\", unlike the AND where only both inputs being \"1\" outputs a \"1\". Its inverted form thus gives an output of \"1\" only when both inputs are \"0\".",
