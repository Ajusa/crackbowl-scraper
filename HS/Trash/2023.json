	"answerText": "HSAB theory [or Pearson hard soft acid base theory; or Pearson theory][10] Parr's definition of hardness can be approximated as half of this quantity, minus electron affinity. This quantity is a measure of how easy it is to remove an electron from an atom in the gaseous state, and the second one is much higher than the first for sodium.",

	"question": "Question: Robert Parr quantified this theory by defining its central concept as half the second derivative of total energy, with respect to electron number. [10] Identify this theory that classifies substances based on their atomic radius, oxidation state, polarizability, electronegativity, HOMO, and LUMO.",
