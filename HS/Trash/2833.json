	"answerText": "photons[10] This process occurs when a photon interacts with an excited atom resulting in the emission of two photons. Einstein names two coefficients that govern this process. To achieve a net gain of photons, generally, a three or higher level system is required because it requires the majority of the atoms to be  excited.",
