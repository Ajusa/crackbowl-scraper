Gleason's Theorem relates a rule named for this physicist to the structure of a lattice of events in Hilbert spaces, and a set of coordinates named for him is used to describe objects rotating at relativistic speeds. For 10 points each: [10] Name this German physicist. He co-names an approximation that represents a molecule's wavefunction as the product of the electronic wavefunction and the nuclear wavefunction.",
