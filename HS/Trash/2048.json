	"answerText": "Lorenz gauge [or Lorentz gauge  yes, that's correct][10] Another popular gauge is the Coulomb gauge because even if the B field varies in time, this equation will be the same as in electrostatics. It gives the Laplacian of the electric potential as equal to charge density over permittivity.",
