	"answerText": "piezoresistivity [or word forms, such as piezoresistive][10] The gauge factor is the ratio of the relative change in electrical resistance to this quantity, whose \"engineering\" form is defined as the change in length over the original length. It's the relative deformation and is paired with stress on namesake diagrams.",
