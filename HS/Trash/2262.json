	"question": "Question: In one example of this type of genetic regulation, the iron response element binding protein binds to the iron response element when it is not complexed with iron, which prevents the translation of ferritin. [10] Name this type of genetic element exemplified by riboswitches, which are sequences of DNA or RNA which regulate the expression of genes located on the same molecule of DNA or RNA as the regulatory sequence.",
