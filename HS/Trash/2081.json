	"question": "Question: For diamond, this value is around 0.34 because covalent bonds don't take up much space. For 10 points each: [10] Name this value, which is equal to the number of particles times the volume of each particle over the volume of the unit cell. For a body-centered cubic structure, it is equal to 0.68.",
