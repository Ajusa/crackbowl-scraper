	"answerText": "Doppler Effect[10] The inverse Doppler Effect requires materials with this property that causes the electric and magnetic fields to be in left-handed coordinates as opposed to the standard right-handed coordinates. Photonic crystals can have this property, which was described in part by Victer Veselago.",
