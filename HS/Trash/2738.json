	"question": "Question: These phenomena originate on cold bodies when tidal interactions heats up internal water and ammonia sufficiently to volatilize them. For 10 points each: [10] Name this cold form of eruption, usually observed on moons which has been hypothesized to happen on Pluto and other Kuiper Belt objects. It resembles a geyser more than its earthly namesake.",
