	"question": "Question: A common rule of thumb for evaluating contributions from resonance structures is that this quantity should be minimized for each atom. For 10 points each: [10] Name this quantity which is similar to an oxidation state, but does not take electronegativity into account. For the carbon atom in carbon monoxide, this quantity is positive one.",
