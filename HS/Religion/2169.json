The Euler-Bernoulli differential equation for the deflection of a beam has this order.",

	"question": "Question: This technique is a first-order Runge-Kutta method and is thus the simplest method of numerical integration for solving ODEs. For 10 points each: [10] Name this method that boils down to adding a small amount to the dependent variable when the derivative is positive and subtracting a small amount when the derivative is negative. It's named for the prolific mathematician who explicated it in Institutionum calculi integralis. ",
