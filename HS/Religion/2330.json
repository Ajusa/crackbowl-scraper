	"answerText": "titration (or titrimetry or volumetric analysis)[10] The point in a titration at which enough titrant has been added to react completely with the analyte is given this name. It is the inflection point of the curve, and for titrations of a strong acid with a strong base the pH at this point is approximately 7.",
