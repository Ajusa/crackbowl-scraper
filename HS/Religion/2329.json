	"question": "Question: For 10 points each, answer some questions about a block on an inclined plane: [10] The force on the block down the plane is equal to the sine of the angle of the plane times this force. It is equal to the mass of the block times the acceleration of gravity. Scales measure this property, which, unlike mass, is different when measured on the moon.",
