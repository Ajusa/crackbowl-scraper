	"question": "Question: . The Verhulst equation models population size using a differential equation. For 10 points each: [10] The graph of the Verhulst equation is this type of S-shaped curve, which asymptotically approaches a long-term maximum value. Unlike the exponential growth function, it accounts for the self-limiting growth of real populations.",
