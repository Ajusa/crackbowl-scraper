	"answerText": "special theory of relativity [accept STR][10] Modeling this process in computational chemistry can involve techniques like COSMO-RS, which has a correction factor depending on the permittivity to account for screening effects in conductors. COSMO-RS is not as good at modeling this phenomenon for highly polar molecules.",

Einstein's theory of this concept gives one important correction to the energies due to the fact that the particles move near the speed of light. It can be accounted for  in the ZORA formalism.",
