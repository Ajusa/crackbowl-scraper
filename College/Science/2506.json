	"answerText": "Nernst equation[10] Some variations of the Nernst equation, like the ButlerVolmer and Tafel equations, contain this term, symbolized nu. It is the difference between the derived half cell reduction potential and the observed reduction potential. This term arises because energy lost as heat makes reactions less efficient than calculations predict.",
