The integer quantum Hall effect is useful in precisely measuring this quantity, the coupling constant in electromagnetism,, which has an approximate value of 1/137.",

	"question": "Question: This effect is generally explained by composite fermion theory. For 10 points each: [10] Name this 2D effect first explained by Laughlin with a test wavefunction. It cannot be modeled as a perturbation and it sees resistance mostly quantized by rational filling factors with odd denominators, although some filling factors with even denominators have been observed.",
