	"answerText": "nonlinear closed orbits [accept nonlinear periodic orbits; accept isolated closed trajectories; accept limit cycles; prompt on partial answers][10] Relaxation oscillations are an important type of closed orbit that features two different orders of magnitude of this quantity. Thus, perturbation theory will fail as unbounded secular terms appear as this term grows to infinity, which is the point where one wants to see the behavior of the orbits.",

	"question": "Question: The Poincare-Bendixson theorem assumes a closed, bounded plane with a differentiable vector field such that that vector field has no fixed points in the region. For 10 points each: [10] Name this phenomenon that the Poincare-Bendixson theorem says must happen in two-dimensional planes that satisfy the assumptions. This nonlinear phenomenon models self-sustained oscillations like the beating of the heart.",
