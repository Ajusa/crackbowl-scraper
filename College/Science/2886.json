	"answerText": "Franck-Condon principle [10] The Franck-Condon principle explains the relative intensities of electronic transitions involved in this phenomenon. Its namesake resonance energy transfer occurs when an excited chromophore transfers its energy to a second chromophore, which releases light of a different wavelength than that absorbed by the first molecule.",
