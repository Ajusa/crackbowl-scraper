Identify the following,  [10] Expressed as a set of non-terminal symbols, a set of terminal symbols, a finite set of mappings from symbol to symbol, and a start symbol, this recursive construction is key to parsing theory. The set of all strings of terminal symbols generated by applying the mappings to the start symbol is the eponymous language of one of these. ",
