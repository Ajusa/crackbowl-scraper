	"question": "Question: Fermi developed an early theory of this interaction which was modified by Gamow and Teller to include parity violation, though the cross-section grows too quickly with the energy to be correct. For 10 points each: [10] Name this fundamental force that mediates beta-decay. Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam managed to combine it with the electromagnetic force, and it is uniquely able to change quark flavors.",
