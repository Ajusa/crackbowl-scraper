	"answerText": "plasma[10] In plasmas, the pinch effect can occur when moving free charges generate this quantity, which then confines the plasma to a very narrow band. For a perfectly conducting fluid, the lines of this quantity move with the fluid, meaning that this quantity is frozen into the plasma by Alfven's theorem.",
