	"question": "Question: This method for solving programs in computer science utilizes a technique called memoization to skip over computations that have already been done. [10] Name this technique that optimizes solutions to problems that may have subproblem overlap by caching values. Pathfinding algorithms may use this technique to store paths while calculating better ones.",
