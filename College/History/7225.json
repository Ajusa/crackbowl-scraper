Sakurai, \"you have to be either a fool or a masochist\" to find the energy shift from this phenomenon using the eigenkets corresponding to the z-direction of the angular momenta.  For 10 points each: [10] Identify this interaction in which the electron feels an effective magnetic field that couples with its intrinsic angular momentum, which helps give rise to the fine structure.",
