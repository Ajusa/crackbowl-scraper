	"answerText": "Dirac notation [prompt on bra-ket notation if they were not paying attention!][10] The inner product of a bra and ket is a generalization of this better known vector operator, which shouldn't be confused with the cross product. It yields a scalar that is the projection of one vector onto another and its formula is given by the magnitude of the 2 vectors times cosine of the angle between them.",
