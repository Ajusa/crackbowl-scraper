	"question": "Question: This equation is sometimes co-named for Langmuir or Boltzmann, and it contains a term of 2 over the third power of the thermal de Broglie wavelength. For 10 points each: [10] Name this equation which gives the proportion of atoms in a gas that have been ionized. It holds when coulomb screening is negligible, and its used to interpret star spectra.",
